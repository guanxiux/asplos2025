We implemented CacheInf with python, pytorch~\cite{paszke2017automatic} and C++ CUDA~\cite{cuda} on Ubuntu20.04.
The major components of CacheInf, namely Cache Analyzer, Cache Combiner and Recomputation Input Constructor are implemented via highly optimized CUDA programming and exposed as python extensions for easy to use.
We recorded that executing these components on our edge robot equipped with Jetson Xavier NX board took on average 4.3ms.
